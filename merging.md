## üí∞ Price Negotiation Playbook (if acquiring PinkLotus.ai)

### 1. **Due Diligence Checklist**

Before making an offer:

* Ask for codebase access (NDA protected) and architecture overview
* Review deployment pipeline (CI/CD, scaling, security)
* Ask for client list and retention/churn rates
* Check how customizable and modular the system is

### 2. **Valuation Range**

| Acquisition Type               | Estimated Value |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- |
| **IP/Code Only**               | ‚Çπ12‚Äì25 Lakhs    |
| **IP + Branding**              | ‚Çπ25‚Äì40 Lakhs    |
| **Full Tech + Clients + Team** | ‚Çπ50 L ‚Äì ‚Çπ1.5 Cr |

Use your traction & POC results (from Agentic AI) to push price **downward**, especially if they:

* Lack behavior analysis
* Have no agriculture integration
* Offer alerts without reasoning/action

### 3. **Negotiation Strategy**

* **Anchor low**: Start by valuing purely on code/IP (‚Çπ15‚Äì20L)
* **De-risk them**: Offer revenue share/transition plan if they're concerned
* **Leverage FOMO**: Mention exploring competing acquisitions if relevant
* **Use your strengths**: Emphasize edge-AI, multi-domain use, agentic logic

## üöÄ Recommendation

If you aim to **acquire and integrate PinkLotus.ai**, do so **only if**:

* Their code accelerates your backend significantly
* They have reusable models or UI components
* You want their client base or geographic penetration

Otherwise, your **Agentic AI** is clearly **technologically superior** and more **differentiated in value**.
