## 🔍 Overview

`ggkh-autogenix` is a research and development space for cutting-edge AI/ML projects led by Gopi Krishna Hanuman Gokavarapu.  
The focus is on:

- 🎥 **Computer Vision** (e.g. YOLOv8 + CCTV-based behavior monitoring)
- 🧠 **Agentic AI Systems** (autonomous agents, multi-modal AI)
- 📊 **ML Experiments** (training, evaluation, and deployment)
- 🧰 **End-to-End PoCs** (AWS SageMaker, Google Colab, ONNX, FastAPI)
