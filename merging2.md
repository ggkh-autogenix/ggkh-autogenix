## 💸 How Much to Offer

| Option                                   | What You Get        | Suggested Price |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| Just Code + Models                       | No help, just files | ₹12–18 Lakhs    |
| Code + Some Support                      | They help a bit     | ₹20–30 Lakhs    |

## 🧠 What You Should Ask Them

These are **smart questions** to get them to reduce their price:

1. **“How many customers do you actually have using this?”**
   → If it’s low, they’ll feel pressure to sell.

2. **“Do you have people to support and maintain this software?”**
   → If not, it’s more work for you—so lower price.

3. **“Can I sell this under my own name?”**
   → Push for full rights or at least white-label options.

4. **“What if your code doesn’t work on our edge devices?”**
   → Makes them understand you’re taking a risk.

5. **“Can I pay you in parts—some now, some when it works?”**
   → Reduces your upfront risk.

## 🚀 How You Can Grow With It

Once you plug their tech into Agentic AI:

* 🎯 **Sell faster** (you already have working base tech)
* 📦 **Add features** (task assignment, idle tracking, agriculture)
* 📈 **Offer plans to malls, offices, farms**
* 💼 **Sell under your brand** (like “Agentic SmartEye”)

You become a **complete solution provider**—not just alerts, but full action system.

## ✅ TL;DR: Quick Action Plan

1. Offer ₹15–30 Lakhs depending on what rights you want
2. Ask smart questions to push price lower
3. Buy only if code is reusable and scalable
4. Add your AI logic, and launch under **Agentic AI**
5. Target sales in malls, factories, farms, offices
