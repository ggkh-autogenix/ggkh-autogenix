The Problem: Cameras Watch, But No One Acts
In a gated community in Bengaluru, children played near a park where garbage piled up for days. Cameras quietly recorded the mess growing, but no one responded. Residents had to escalate the issue online, frustrated that surveillance existed—but action didn’t.

Across the country in Varanasi, a 15-year-old girl faced a terrifying moment when someone attempted to assault her in a hospital corridor. CCTV captured every second, yet there was no alert, no real-time intervention. The camera merely observed. It did not protect.

In Mumbai, smoke began to curl up from a food court kitchen in a bustling shopping mall. A faulty exhaust fan sparked a fire. Panic spread. Alarms blared—but not because of surveillance. The cameras saw it all, but no system was in place to detect the smoke or raise the alarm early.

Retail stores are no exception. Chains like V-Mart and Trent reported mounting losses from theft and stock discrepancies. Cameras captured these losses in real-time, but without intelligence or alert systems, store managers were always reacting too late.

Even in agriculture, where the stakes are seasonal and severe, the problem persists. In Karnataka, fake seeds and fertilizers circulated freely. Entire harvests were at risk. There were no visual checks or tracking mechanisms, just silent footage of distribution centers and godowns.

Across all these sectors, one pattern emerges: cameras are everywhere—but decisions, alerts, and actions are missing. Surveillance has become a passive witness, not a proactive guardian.
